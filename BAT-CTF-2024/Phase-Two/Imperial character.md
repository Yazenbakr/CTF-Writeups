this was the message provided with the challenge, we can notice that there is an encoded text

"YXQq1kd q1kd 1p Qo4afqflk4i d4j3"

the text mentions Caesar Cipher, we can use it or use ROT (rotation of 3 letters), to get the answer.

"BATt1ng t1ng 1s Tr4dition4l g4m3"
this is the output.

finally, here's the flag:
BAT{t1ng_t1ng_1s_Tr4dition4l_g4m3}
