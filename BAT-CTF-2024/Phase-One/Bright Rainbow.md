Description: “Wala left me a message, can you help me to read it ? she told me that the message is the password of my archive idk.”

The challenge came with a png image “Chapteh.png” and a locked zip file “idk.zip”.

For this challenge I went through the metadata and found nothing, there was also no hidden files, the title when using exif tool was the only hint I found, but It didn’t work as the password.

So, i tried to test the image itself in order to find any hidden information on it, so “StegSolve” Tool was used to put the filters.

If you notice there is the passcode “{2_th0us4nd_y34rs_4g0}” on the blue feather, it is the password for the idk.zip file.
