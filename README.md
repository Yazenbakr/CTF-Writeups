# CTF-Writeups
write-ups for some of the CTF challenges I solve, and for the challenges I create as well :)

Web exploitation, Forensics, Cryptography, and Stegano are what I enjoy the most, so many of the write-ups will be from these categories.
feel free to reach out for further explanation on the write-ups.
